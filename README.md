# tidytuesday

Tidy Tuesday is a weekly R4DS community data project where a new dataset is added weekly where anyone can download and visualize the data. The goal is to practice exploring data and visualizing it.

Week 1 (for me)
I finally created my [first tidy tuesday visualization](https://github.com/chrisselig/tidyTuesday/tree/master/2020_04_07) on the Tour de France winners. My goal was to learn about the new [gt package](https://gt.rstudio.com/index.html) that was released for creating nice, publication ready tables.
